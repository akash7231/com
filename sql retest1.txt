Identify required tables, columns and their relationship to represent the above information. 
Write the SQL   commands to represent the schema (tables) in the database.	

BAND TABLE:
 CREATE table band(device_id number(10) primary key,
      		model_name varchar2(15),
		heart_rate varchar2(30),
		BP varchar2(30));

CUSTOMER TABLE:
CREATE table customer(customer_id number(10) primary key,
			customer_name varchar2(15),
			date_of_birth date,address varchar2(30),
			emergency_contact_of_family number(10),
			emergency_contact_of_doctor number(10),
			device_id number(10) references band(device_id));
  
ALERT_MESSAGE TABLE:
CREATE table alert_message(message_id number(10) primary key, 
			time_of _alert date,
			 location varchar2(15),
			alert message varchar2(30),
			customer_id number(10) references customer(customer_id));

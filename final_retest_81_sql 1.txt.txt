8)   A foreign key with cascade delete means that if a record in the parent table is deleted, then the corresponding records in the child table will automatically be deleted. This is called a cascade delete in SQL Server.

A foreign key with cascade delete can be created using either a CREATE TABLE statement or an ALTER TABLE statement.
